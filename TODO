CHECK HAS DEMONS AND GOBLINS!!!!
CHECK FIX AVERAGE. IT SHOULDNT COUNT GAMES NOT PLAYED.  I SHOULD HAVE ALL STATS IN EVALUATE.


USE DEMONS AND GOBLINS.

Refactor:
use class (shouldnt use globals)

add ties to hit rate somehow?

Can remove get_stat_from_last_x_games() not really using it????

Further Analysis - 
-Look at news sources, ask AI if ok.  Injured teammates...
-Look at minute trends
-Look at season averages
-Look at trends.
-Compare last 10Games/20Games/XGames (have it custom to where it can tell us the best pct)
-Use Demons and Goblins, calculate EV to see if bet is worth.
